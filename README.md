## Purpose:
The purpose of this quiz was to test peoples general knowledge, keep track of their score, and then add their names to a high score leaderboard.



# My Idea:
* My  idea for this project was to make a quiz that could test all levels of knowledge, from children to adults.

# My Quiz:
## Home Page Features:
* A home page with a play button and highscore button.
## Quiz Page Features:
* A quiz page with a home button, questions, answers, and a score counter.
## End Page Features:
* The end page feature has a save, play again, and a home button option. Also, there is an input box to enter their name for highscore memory.
## Highscore Page Features
* The highscore page shows which users have recieved the highest scores. Also, a home button is on display.
## Combined Features for all Pages:
* A good balance of questions to test all minds.
* Bright colours on all pages so the user can clearly see everything on the pages.
* A finger pointer cursor that changes on different parts of the page to show the user what to do.
*  A color coding framework for right and wrong answers, where right answers turn green and wrong answers turn red.
* A highscore tracker to keep a log of every username and score.

# UX/UI
The quiz was created to show my programming knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# Site Goals

* To show what I have learned in CSS, JAVASCRIPT and HTML. 
* To provide an interactive experience that is easily accessible in terms of navigation and to manouver throughout the site.
* To personalise each users highscore to the quizes leaderboard.
* To easily be able to see their progress and how many questions are left.
* To display how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz at all times.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to encourage the user to play the game.
* Questions to be randomised and drawn from the bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to leave the quiz if they wish to, and return to the home page.<br><br>
#

# The overall goal:
* To be easy for the user to start game play.
* For users to easily navigate throughout the site.
* To be able to visit the leaderboard and review highscores.


#
# Requirements 
- Corresponds to all screen sizes and devices.
- Accessible and user friendly quiz.
- Keeps the user engaged throughout their experience. This includes the functions of the progress bar, score counter, end score total, and then attaches each name to the leaderboard. 
- User friendly and clear navigation methods.


#
# Expectations 
- Every part of my quiz worked as it was meant to.
- Each  button worked functionally when it was pressed and brought the user to the correct page.
- For it to be responsive regardless of what device the user chose to be on.
- All question and answer functions worked as they should in a clear and concise manner.
#

# Design 
- I used bright colours to make the quiz stand out and create an attractive layout.
- I used the Nova Squared font so all the writing was clear and readable for the user.
- I used big boxes throughout so that users could continuously see what te cursor was doing.
#

# Functionality
* All buttons and links have been hovered over and clicked on to ensure accessibility.
* All pages load correctly across all device screen sizes (Please see testing section).
* Functional buttons worked as intended and on different device screen sizes.

#

# Testing
* Testing was carried on on a Dell latitude 7480, Samsumg galaxy s20 se, Samsung a7 tablet and a Samsung note 20+.

#
# Bugs and Errors:
* Initially, my Javascript had two bugs, the first issue was in the Javascript game. When i added a highscore it returned a response of null. However, with the help of Google and Slack, I finally realised that when the user pressed save, the option was disabled. Nevertheless, this issue was remedied easily as I just enabled the save button.

* The second issue was that my CSS file was different on all pages and I coudnt understand why. So, thanks to my mentor who helped me to recognise that I had forgotten to link my CSS file to each page in my HTML files.<br><br>

# Deployment:
* To deploy my project, I went to Github and entered my "The-Big-Quiz repository". Then, I
continued into the settings, once in settings I proceeded into the Github pages. Once in Github, I deployed from a branch and then used a main branch and pressed save. Then, I copied my Github.io link and pasted it into my readME.md file.
